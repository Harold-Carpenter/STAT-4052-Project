```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Packages

I imported the collection of `tidyverse` packages which contains multiple packages used for data wrangling and cleaning.

``` {r packages}
library(tidyverse) 
```


## Raw data

**counties.csv** - contains features at the county level
**deaths_timeseries.scv** - timeseries data of deaths at the county level (1/22 to 4/27)

``` {r data}
# local paths to two files
counties <- read.csv(file = "../COVID-19_US_County-level_Summaries-master/data/counties.csv") %>%
  as.data.frame()
  
deaths_timeseries <- read.csv(file = "../COVID-19_US_County-level_Summaries-master/data/deaths_timeseries.csv") %>%
  as.data.frame()
```
